Role
====

Provide an easy way to build a chain of decorators extending the
functionalities of the default plugin manager, when it comes to
activating, deactivating or looking into loaded plugins.

The ``PluginManagerDecorator`` is the base class to be inherited by
each element of the chain of decorator.

.. warning:: If you want to customise the way the plugins are detected
             and loaded, you should not try to do it by implementing a
             new ``PluginManagerDecorator``. Instead, you'll have to
             reimplement the :doc:`PluginManager` itself. And if you
             do so by enforcing the ``PluginManager`` interface, just
             giving an instance of your new manager class to the
             ``PluginManagerDecorator`` should be transparent to the
             "stantard" decorators.
