Role
====

The ``PluginManager`` loads plugins that enforce the `Plugin
Description Policy`_, and offers the most simple methods to activate
and deactivate the plugins once they are loaded.

.. note:: It may also classify the plugins in various categories, but
          this behaviour is optional and if not specified elseway all
          plugins are stored in the same default category.

.. note:: It is often more useful to have the plugin manager behave
          like singleton, this functionality is provided by
          ``PluginManagerSingleton``


Plugin Description Policy
=========================

When creating a ``PluginManager`` instance, one should provide it with
a list of directories where plugins may be found. In each directory,
a plugin should contain the following elements:

For a  *Standard* plugin:

  ``myplugin.yapsy-plugin`` 
 
      A *plugin info file* identical to the one previously described.
 
  ``myplugin``
 
      A directory ontaining an actual Python plugin (ie with a
      ``__init__.py`` file that makes it importable). The upper
      namespace of the plugin should present a class inheriting the
      ``IPlugin`` interface (the same remarks apply here as in the
      previous case).


For a *Single file* plugin:

  ``myplugin.yapsy-plugin`` 
       
    A *plugin info file* which is identified thanks to its extension,
    see the `Plugin Info File Format`_ to see what should be in this
    file.
    
  
    The extension is customisable at the ``PluginManager``'s
    instanciation, since one may usually prefer the extension to bear
    the application name.
  
  ``myplugin.py``
  
     The source of the plugin. This file should at least define a class
     inheriting the ``IPlugin`` interface. This class will be
     instanciated at plugin loading and it will be notified the
     activation/deactivation events.


Plugin Info File Format
-----------------------

The plugin info file gathers, as its name suggests, some basic
information about the plugin.

- it gives crucial information needed to be able to load the plugin

- it provides some documentation like information like the plugin
  author's name and a short description fo the plugin functionality.

Here is an example of what such a file should contain::

	  [Core]
	  Name = My plugin Name
	  Module = the_name_of_the_pluginto_load_with_no_py_ending
         
	  [Documentation]
	  Description = What my plugin broadly does
	  Author = My very own name
	  Version = 0.1
	  Website = My very own website
	  Version = the_version_number_of_the_plugin
	  
	 
.. note:: From such plugin descriptions, the ``PluginManager`` will
          built its own representations of the plugins as instances of
          the :doc:`PluginInfo` class.


Extensibility
=============

Several mechanisms have been put up to help extending the basic
functionalities of the proivided classes.

A few *hints* to help you extend those classes:

If the new functionalities do not overlap the ones already
implemented, then they should be implemented as a Decorator class of the
base plugin. This should be done by inheriting the
``PluginManagerDecorator``.

If this previous way is not possible, then the functionalities should
be added as a subclass of ``PluginManager``.

.. note:: The first method is highly prefered since it makes it
          possible to have a more flexible design where one can pick
          several functionalities and litterally *add* them to get an
          object corresponding to one's precise needs.
