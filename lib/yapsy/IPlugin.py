"""
Role
====

Defines the basic interfaces for a plugin. These interfaces are
inherited by the *core* class of a plugin. The *core* class of a
plugin is then the one that will be notified the
activation/deactivation of a plugin via the ``activate/deactivate``
methods.


For simple (near trivial) plugin systems, one can directly use the
following interfaces.

Extensibility
=============

In your own software, you'll probably want to build derived classes of
the ``IPlugin`` class as it is a mere interface with no specific
functionality.

Your software's plugins should then inherit your very own plugin class
(itself derived from ``IPlugin``).

Where and how to code these plugins is explained in the section about
the :doc:`PluginManager`.
